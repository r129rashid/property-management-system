# Handoff — Abhay's PMS

## Current State
App is live on Vercel (`property-management-system-coral.vercel.app`).
No known bugs. All features working. Dark mode is the default across the entire app.

## All Changes Made (Sessions 1–4)

### Session 1–2: Core build + bug fixes
| What | Files |
|------|-------|
| Full app build: auth, dashboard, records CRUD, activity log, document upload | Multiple |
| Fix: dashboard crash — RSC serialization of Lucide icon forwardRef | `components/dashboard/KpiCard.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` |
| Fix: redirect() inside Suspense boundary | `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` |
| Fix: activity log "Invalid Date" — schema mismatch in logActivity | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx`, `components/shared/ActivityLog.tsx` |

### Session 3: UI polish
| What | Files |
|------|-------|
| Records table: Edit/Delete/Generate Agreement → three-dot `DropdownMenu` | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Records table: quick inline "Paid" button on unpaid rows | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Records page header: "Records" → "Rental Ledger" | `app/(dashboard)/records/page.tsx` |
| Overdue KPI card: clickable → `/records?status=overdue` | `components/dashboard/KpiCard.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` |
| RecordsTable: reads `?status` URL param to initialise filter | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Login redesign: glass card, accent bar, show/hide password | `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` |

### Session 4: Animated login + dark mode + brand
| What | Files |
|------|-------|
| Auth layout: 5 Framer Motion gradient orbs (indigo/violet/cyan/blue/pink), dot grid, vignette, forced dark `#060b18` | `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` |
| Login card: glass morphism backdrop-blur, staggered entrance animations | `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` |
| Brand: "PropManage" → "Abhay's PMS" everywhere | `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx` |
| App-wide dark default: `defaultTheme="dark"`, `enableSystem` removed | `components/providers.tsx` |
| Remember Me: checkbox saves email to localStorage; pre-fills on next visit | `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` |

## Key Conventions (for next session)
- **Dark mode**: `ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark"` — dark is the default; user can toggle via header button
- **Auth layout**: `"use client"` — uses Framer Motion; adds `class="dark"` to wrapper so login is always dark regardless of toggle
- **Remember Me key**: `pms_remembered_email` in localStorage (email only, never password)
- **KpiCard href**: pass `href` prop to make a card clickable; links to `/records?status=X`
- **RecordsTable filter from URL**: navigate to `/records?status=overdue|paid|unpaid` to pre-filter on load

## Known Open Issue
`proxy.ts` at project root is NOT recognised by Next.js as middleware:
- Named `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`
- Exports `proxy` instead of a default export
- Auth relies solely on in-page `redirect()` calls — no route-level protection
- **Fix:** rename → `middleware.ts`, change to `export default async function middleware`

### Session 5: Paid status controls — desktop + mobile
| What | Files |
|------|-------|
| Three-dot menu: "Mark as paid" (green) when unpaid; "Mark as unpaid" when paid | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Desktop quick action: "Mark as paid" button when unpaid; static green "Paid" label when paid | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Mobile bug fix: quick "Mark as paid" button was missing — root cause was mobile cards bypass TanStack columns entirely; added button directly to card layout | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Mobile three-dot: "Mark as paid" when unpaid; "Mark as unpaid" + "Download receipt" when paid | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |
| Added `handleMarkUnpaid` handler — sets `amount_paid: false` in Supabase | `components/table/RecordsTable.tsx` |

## Key Conventions (for next session)
- **Dark mode**: `ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark"` — dark is the default; user can toggle via header button
- **Auth layout**: `"use client"` — uses Framer Motion; adds `class="dark"` to wrapper so login is always dark regardless of toggle
- **Remember Me key**: `pms_remembered_email` in localStorage (email only, never password)
- **KpiCard href**: pass `href` prop to make a card clickable; links to `/records?status=X`
- **RecordsTable filter from URL**: navigate to `/records?status=overdue|paid|unpaid` to pre-filter on load
- **Mobile records**: uses custom card rendering (not TanStack Table columns) — any action added to the `actions` column cell will NOT appear on mobile; must be added to the card JSX separately

## Known Open Issue
`proxy.ts` at project root is NOT recognised by Next.js as middleware:
- Named `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`
- Exports `proxy` instead of a default export
- Auth relies solely on in-page `redirect()` calls — no route-level protection
- **Fix:** rename → `middleware.ts`, change to `export default async function middleware`

## What the Next Session Could Do
- Implement "Generate Agreement" — PDF generation with tenant/property details (jsPDF already installed)
- Fix the middleware naming issue above for proper route-level auth protection
- Apply the same animated dark treatment to the signup page
- Add `/records?status=paid` click-through from the Monthly Rent or a paid-count KPI
- Consider adding a "Due Soon" KPI card that links to `/records?status=unpaid`
